    """Finds and returns the roots of a system of functions on the search interval [a,b].

    Generates an approximation for each function using Chebyshev polynomials on the interval given,
    then uses properties of the approximations to shrink the search interval. When the information
    contained in the approximation is insufficient to shrink the interval further, the interval is
    subdivided into subregions, and the searching function is recursively called until it zeros in
    on each root. A specific point (and, optionally, a bounding box) is returned for each root found.

    NOTE: YRoots uses just-in-time compiling with an on-disk cache. The first time the solver is called at
    a given dimension on any given install, numba compiles the required specializations (which takes several
    seconds or minutes) and writes them to ``yroots/__pycache__/`` as ``.nbi``/``.nbc`` files. Every later Python
    process that solves a system of that same dimension loads the compiled code from disk on first call
    instead of recompiling. The cache is invalidated automatically when the source file or the numba
    version changes, and it is rebuilt lazily on the next call. Because the cache is keyed by the dimension
    of the system (a new type signature per dimension), the very first solve at each new dimension on a
    fresh install still pays a one-time compile cost.

    After the cache is keyed for a certain dimension, a fresh Python process still pays roughly one second or less of
    import overhead the first time it does ``import yroots`` (for numpy, numba, and the yroots modules
    themselves), and each new dimension adds roughly 30-50 ms to its first solve call for reading the
    cached binaries from disk, linking them, and populating numba's dispatch table. However, both costs are
    per-process rather than per-call, essentially replacing a multi-second/minute warmup with a couple seconds of warmup.

    NOTE: The solve function is only guaranteed to work well on systems of equations where each function
    is continuous and smooth and each root in the interval is a simple root. If a function is not
    continuous and smooth on an interval or an infinite number of roots exist in the interval, the
    solver may get stuck in recursion or the kernel may crash.

    Parameters
    ----------
    funcs : list
        List of functions for searching. NOTE: Valid input is restricted to callable Python functions
        (including user-created functions) and yroots Polynomial (MultiCheb and MultiPower) objects.
        String representations of functions are not valid input.
    a : list or numpy array
        An array containing the lower bound of the search interval in each dimension, listed in
        dimension order. If the lower bound is to be the same in each dimension, a single float input
        is also accepted. Defaults to -1 in each dimension if no input is given.
    b : list or numpy array
        An array containing the upper bound of the search interval in each dimension, listed in
        dimension order. If the upper bound is to be the same in each dimension, a single float input
        is also accepted. Defaults to 1 in each dimension if no input is given.
    verbose : bool
        Defaults to False. When True, prints progress of approximation and rootfinding to the terminal.
        Useful for long-running systems.
    returnBoundingBoxes : bool
        Defaults to False. Whether or not to return a precise bounding box for each root.
    exact : bool
        Defaults to False. Whether transformations performed on the approximation should be performed
        with higher precision to minimize error.
    minBoundingIntervalSize : float
        Defaults to 1e-5. If a root is found with a bounding interval of size > minBoundingIntervalSize in
        each dimension, the functions are solved again on the smaller interval. Setting too small could cause
        issues if the functions can't be evaluated accurately on points close together, and will increase solve
        times. Should give more accurate roots when smaller. This number is absolute when the bounding interval in
        question is in [-1,1], and relative otherwise. So if an interval has an endpoint of magnitude > 1, then
        minBoundingIntervalSize is multiplied by that value for that dimension.
    _refine : bool
        Internal. Whether to solve again around a root whose box stayed wide (see _refineWideBoxes).
        False on the solves that refinement itself makes, so it happens once.
    _maxDegree : int or None
        Internal. The highest degree a callable's approximation may take (see REFINE_MAX_DEGREE).
    _dupSets : list or None
        Internal. Where the solves this one makes collect the sets of roots that might be duplicates, so
        the call the user made warns about all of them once. None on that call.

    Returns
    -------
    roots : numpy array
        The roots of the system of functions on the interval.
    boundingBoxes : numpy array, optional
        Only returned when ``returnBoundingBoxes`` is True. The exact intervals (boxes) in
        which each root is bound to lie.
